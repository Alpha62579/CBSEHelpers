# CBSEHelpers

A collection of helper functions for my stupid CS project at school.

So my school requires me to do a project but since I wasn't allowed to write any syntax outside of what was taught
at school, I decided to pass it off as a library since 3rd party libraries are allowed.

## Install
 - `pip install https://repos.alpha62579.repl.co/helpers`
