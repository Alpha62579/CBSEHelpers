# CBSEHelpers

A collection of helper functions for my stupid CS project at school.

So my school requires me to do a project but since I wasn't allowed to write any syntax outside of what was taught
at school unless my team members (who aren't great at this) also have to explain what the hell I did, 
I decided to pass it off as a library since 3rd party libraries are allowed.

Yes it does clash with [this library](https://github.com/infosmith/helpers) but I don't care. If you're one of 
those unlucky people, feel free to make your own fork and change the name.

I won't be putting this on PyPI since this is meant for personal use in the first place.
